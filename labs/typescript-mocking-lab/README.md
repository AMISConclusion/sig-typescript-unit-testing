# Vitest Mocking labs
This lab was based on the typescript standards repo, including the vitest setup.

In the course of this lab, we will be completing the tests in the test/labs folder. Each test is missing the mocks, and the verifications on those mocks.
The functionality that will be tested is a set of helloWorld functions, each with some different dependencies that need to be mocked. 

The solutions with explenation are located in test/solutions. There is often more than one way to tackle a problem, so don't worry if your solution differs. 

## Requirements
- VSCode (or another code editor, but preferably VSCode)
- Vitest vscode plugin (Usefull for running tests)
- NodeJS and NPM (https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Preperation
